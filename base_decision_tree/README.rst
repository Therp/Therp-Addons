==============
Decision trees
==============

This module was written to allow users to manage decision trees. This can be
useful for documentation purposes, but also as an accessible way to work on
a specification with a customer.

You find the functionality in Settings / Decisiion trees. The form allows you
to fill in children inline, which updates the preview of this subtree below.
You can open any of the children by clicking its box in that preview. This an
going back in the breadcrumb allow for quite convenient filling in.
