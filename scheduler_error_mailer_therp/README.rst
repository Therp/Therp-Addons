Configure scheduler_error_mailer for Therp
==========================================

This module configures cronjobs in a way that exceptions raised in cron jobs will be mailed to Therp's helpdesk.

If you're not affiliated with Therp, this module won't do you any good, but you're welcome to copy it in order to have your own version of it. Just be sure to change the recipient email address of the mail template then.
