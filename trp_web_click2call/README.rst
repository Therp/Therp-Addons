Click2call is a simple extension on Asterisk based Astium PBX.
This module adds a field for the user's phone extension as well
as some simple configuration data on the company.
Phone numbers in OpenERP are complemented with buttons that perform the
call to the PBX so that the user gets connected with the partner
that the phone number belongs to.
